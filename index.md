Our aim in this workshop is to teach you basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for genomics and life sciences research including: 
best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, use of command-line 
utilities, use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and
perform variant calling, and connecting to and using High Performance Computing. 

> ## Getting Started
>
> This lesson assumes that learners have no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop. 
> However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts,
> including the 
> concept of genomic variation within a population. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively. 
> 
> To get started, follow the directions in the [Setup](setup.html) tab to 
> get access to the required software and data for this workshop.

> ## Data
> 
> This workshop uses data from a long term evolution experiment published in 2016: [Tempo and mode of genome evolution in a 50,000-generation experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988878/) by Tenaillon O, Barrick JE, Ribeck N, Deatherage DE, Blanchard JL, Dasgupta A, Wu GC, Wielgoss S, Cruveiller S, MÃ©digue C, Schneider D, and Lenski RE. (doi: 10.1038/nature18959)

# Workshop Overview 

| Lesson    | Overview |
| ------- | ---------- |
| [Project organization and management](https://datacarpentry.github.io/organization-genomics/) | Learn how to structure your metadata, organize and document your genomics data and bioinformatics workflow, and access data on the NCBI sequence read archive (SRA) database.|
| [Introduction to the command line](https://datacarpentry.github.io/shell-genomics/) |  Learn to navigate your file system, create, copy, move, and remove files and directories, and automate repetitive tasks using scripts and wildcards. |
|[Data wrangling and processing](https://datacarpentry.github.io/wrangling-genomics/) | Use command-line tools to perform quality control, align reads to a reference genome, and identify and visualize between-sample variation. |


# Teaching Platform
This workshop is designed to be run on either your local PC/Mac or on the University of Leeds High performance Computing clusters.
