## Resouces for Instructors
We have an [onboarding video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zgdutO5tejo) available to prepare Instructors to teach these lessons. 
The slides presented in this video are available: https://tinyurl.com/y27swdvo. 
After watching this video, please contact [team@carpentries.org](mailto: team@carpentries.org) so that we can record 
your status as an onboarded Instructor. Instructors who have completed onboarding will be given priority status for teaching at 
centrally-organized Carpentries workshops.
